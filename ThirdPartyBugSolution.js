The solution usually involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Verify Library Installation:** Double-check that the library is correctly installed using `npm list` or `yarn list`.  Make sure all dependencies are also correctly installed.
2. **Check Linking (if applicable):**  Many libraries require manual linking of native modules. Follow the library's documentation precisely for linking instructions.  For iOS, this might involve Xcode project modifications. For Android, it might involve adjusting `android/settings.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files.
3. **Review Library Documentation:** Carefully read through the library's documentation. Look for known issues, troubleshooting sections, or compatibility notes that might address similar problems.
4. **Examine Build Logs:**  Analyze the build logs meticulously. The cryptic error message may have a hint within it that points to a specific file, line of code, or dependency conflict.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Often, a simple clean and rebuild of the project can resolve transient issues.  Use `npm run clean` or `yarn run clean` followed by a fresh build.
6. **Check for Dependency Conflicts:** Analyze your `package.json` (or `yarn.lock`) file for potential conflicts between different libraries. You might need to adjust dependency versions or use a conflict resolution tool.
7. **Simplify (if necessary):**  Create a minimal reproducible example by stripping down your project to the bare essentials while retaining the problematic library and functionality. This can help isolate the exact source of the issue.
8. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search online (Stack Overflow, GitHub) for similar error messages or problems related to the specific library.  Many developers have faced the same issues, and solutions are often available.
